  <h1 class="h1">Location</h1>

  <p>
    Being one of the core events in an entire week full of community-driven conferences, hackathons, and social events, CSSconf.eu will gather an international audience of top notch frontend developers and designers in Berlin, Europe’s exciting and vibrant tech hub.
  </p>

  <h2 class="h2">Villa Elisabeth</h2>
  <p>
    The historical building and former church parish is now an event space for Berlin’s creative scene and offers a unique atmosphere. On the day of our event, the adjacent church and small park will be used for fringe events, like the nodecopter hackathon.
  </p>
  <p>
    CSSconf.eu will be an amazing event that focuses on intimacy instead of volume.
