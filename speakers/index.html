  <h1 class="h1">Speakers</h1>
  <p>
    List of all speakers goes here. Two options:
    <ol>
      <li>
        Show only picture, name, talk title and a link to a separate speaker page with full description. 
        <br>Pro: We can directly link to the speaker page from e.g. the schedule, twitter etc.
      </li>
      <li>
        Show speakers with full description on one page.
        <br>Pro: Less work for us, less clicking for users.
      </li>
    </ol>
