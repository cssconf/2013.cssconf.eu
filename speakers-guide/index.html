  <h3>Technical information and conference schedule</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The day will start at 9am with the registration, talks will start around 10am. It’d be good if you can be there before 10am, so we can setup your laptop for a test run to make sure everything works.</li>

    <li>
      There will be daylight in the venue. The projector is pretty strong (15k ANSI lumens) but having slides with a good contrast won’t hurt.
    </li>
    <li>Projector resolution: 1024x768 (4:3)</li>
    <li>You can connect to the projector with VGA or DVI. We will have adapters.</li>

    <li>There will be WiFi access for you as well as ethernet access. It should be reliable, but you’re always better off to have a fallback in case the connection doesn’t work.</li>

    <li>You can connect your laptop to the audio, cable will be provided</li>

    <li>There will be power supplies</li>

    <li>You’ll have a headset, so you’ll have your hands free during the talk</li>
    <li>Talk slot is 30 minutes, no Q&amp;A. We believe it’s way better to discuss things in a smaller group afterwards and you'll have enough time and space to do that.</li>
    <li>All talks will be professionally recorded and released afterwards. They will be accessible for everyone (for free), so everyone can learn from the awesome talks you’re going to deliver. If you don’t agree to have your talk published and recorded, please let us know.</li>
    <li>If you’re going to show code remember to increase the font size. A lot ;-)</li>

  </ul>

  <h3>Stuff to do, fringe events</h3>

  <h3>Anti-jerk Policy</h3>
  <p>One last, but very important point: We’re an inclusive community and our goal is to broaden the community and to be a place for everyone to make new friends, share knowledge, learn new stuff, get excited and gain insights. No matter which skin color, gender, sexual preference or whatever. We’re all in the same community and we want it to be awesome and welcoming – Should you encounter or observe any form of harrassment, please let us know and we’ll take care of it</p>
