<p class="nd">A great day requires a great party and this is exactly what’s going to happen. We prepared everything for spending some more great time with you after the conference at the <a href="http://andyet.com/" target="_blank" class="spnsr"><img src="http://2013.cssconf.eu/static/img/logos/lg_andyet.svg" alt="&amp;yet" /></a> after party!</p>

<p>From 8pm, we’ll meet you only a 15-minutes-walk away from our venue at <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/svhlr" target="_blank">BeachMitte</a> in the heart of Berlin. The beach (yes, there’s a beach just in the town’s centre) is located besides a beautiful park (“Park am Nordbahnhof”) and a great place for feeling like on a short vacation and having a good time with friends and lovely people.</p>

<br/>

<p>This evening is all yours - for having drinks with the CSS-community, sharing knowledge and talking to our speakers while listening to wonderful music brought to you by our DJs. </p>
