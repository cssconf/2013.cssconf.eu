  talktitle: Maths-powered transforms for creating 3D shapes
  talkdescription: Transforms are incredibly powerful and immensely helpful when we want to create any kind of polygon starting from humble rectangles. Or when we want to take these polygonal shapes and assemble them into polyhedra. Or even when we want to create various 3D surfaces starting from nothing more than a curvy border. Understanding the mathematical reasoning behind is crucial in order to be able to achieve wonderful and visually stunning things.
