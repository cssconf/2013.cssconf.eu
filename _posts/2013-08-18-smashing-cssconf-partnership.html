<p>We’re very excited to announce a CSSconf.eu partnership with <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/">Smashing Magazine</a>! For many of you Smashing is the daily source of both inspiration and knowledge. This Freiburg-based powerhouse has played a huge role in shaping the design and development community as we know it, not only by supporting various events but also providing quality content for over 7 years already.</p>

<p>Vitaly, Editor-in-Chief (<a href="http://lanyrd.com/profile/smashingmag/">who himself spoke at 35 events in 15 countries</a>) will be joining us as an attendee right after running his own conference, SmashingConf. While the conference itself is already sold out, you can still <a href="http://smashingconf.com/registration">grab tickets</a> for workshops with Dan Rubin, Dan Mall, Luke Wroblewski or Brad Frost. Make sure to follow <a href="http://twitter.com/smashingmag">@smashingmag’s Twitter</a> feed for updates!</p>
