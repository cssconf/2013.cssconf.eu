We are very happy to confirm our first two speakers: Alex Sexton (<a href="https://twitter.com/slexaxton" target="_blank">@slexaxton</a>) and Harry Roberts (<a href="https://twitter.com/csswizardry" target="_blank">@csswizardry</a>).
We’re amazed by the amount and quality of the proposals we received. Expect more additions to the line-up soon!

  Just about everyone is using a CSS preprocessor these days. Some like them just for the variables, and others use all the crazy inline functions and whitespace significance features. They’re often treated as black boxes. My code goes in, and CSS comes out. This talk will be a deep dive into the digestive tract of your CSS preprocessor. Learn how your original code is parsed and stored, and then how that information is used to generate valid CSS. If there’s time, we’ll also talk about introducing parasites into your system for some interesting looking results!

  As part of my efforts in writing performant and scalable CSS, I often push back on designs to improve the quality of the resulting code. Users don’t interact with PSDs, they interact with websites, so it’s often better to push back on certain visual flourishes in order to make that code more robust, performant and scalable. In this talk I would discuss some areas I look at, and techniques I employ, in order to deliver better quality code at the cost of altering and pushing back on design.
