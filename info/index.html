  <h1 class="h1">Information</h1>

  <p>
    Being one of the core events in an entire week full of community-driven conferences, hackathons, and social events, CSSconf.eu will gather an international audience of top notch frontend developers and designers in Berlin, Germany.
  </p>

  <h2 class="h3">Venue</h2>
  <p>
    CSSconf.eu will be a unique event that focuses on intimacy instead of volume. The historical building of Villa Elisabeth creates the perfect setting. Located in the heart of Berlin and very close to hotels, nightlife, restaurants and the buzzing Mitte district, Villa Elisabeth is a quiet and relaxed gem hidden in a small park. On the day of our event, drones will be flying in the adjacent church as part of the nodecopter hackathon.
