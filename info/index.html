  <h3>Dedicated to all people who love and write CSS</h3>

  <p>
    In the late days of 2013’s summer, CSSconf.eu will unite the CSS-community in Berlin. This is your chance to meet top-notch engineers, world-class speakers, great web designers and all people who care about CSS. On this one-day, one-track conference, CSSconf.eu aims to continue what <a href="http://cssconf.com">CSSconf US</a> started earlier this year in Florida.
  </p>

  <p>
    Be a part of it, join us in Berlin!
  </p>

  <h2 class="h3">Date</h2>
  <p>
    CSSconf.eu will happen on September 13th in Berlin and offer one day packed with promising talks (want details? See our <a href="/schedule">schedule</a>!) and time to spend with great people.
  </p>

  <h2 class="h3">Venue</h2>
  <p>
    The historical building of Villa Elisabeth, a quiet and relaxed gem hidden creates the perfect setting for a great day: hidden in a small park, located in the heart of Berlin and very close to hotels, nightlife, restaurants and the buzzing Mitte district. By the way: On the day of our event, drones will be flying in the adjacent church as part of the NodeCopter hackathon.

  </p>


  <h4>Public transport apps: web &amp; mobile</h4>
  <p>There’s also various mobile public transport apps that help you get to Villa Elisabeth easily from your current location. Just add “Invalidenstr. 3, Berlin” as your destination and these nice little tools will help you find your best way:</p>
  <ul>

    </li>
  </ul>


  <h4>Parking</h4>
  <p>
    As in Berlin Centre it’s usually hard to find free parking space (and unfortunately, they’re not cheap either), we recommend public transport. Some hotels offer free car parks during your stay, just ask when booking. Find a list of all covered car parks <a href="http://www.berlin.de/special/auto-und-motor/893408-44826-parkh%C3%A4userinberlin.html">here</a> (scroll down to “Stadtmitte”, these are closest to the venue).
  </p>

  <h4>Car Sharing</h4>
  <p>
    There’s various suppliers for car sharing in Berlin giving you the opportunity to pick cars (they have an app for that) and drop them off (mostly) wherever you want to. The best-known are <a href="https://de.drive-now.com/home/?L=1&language=en_GB">DriveNow</a>, <a href="https://www.car2go.com/en/berlin/">Car2Go</a> and <a href="https://www.multicity-carsharing.de/">Multicity</a>. Please mind that the registration process may take some time and all companies require registration fees, so it may be only worth your consideration if you’re planning a longer stay in town.
